# NBA Power Rankings
A website that helps generates power rankings for NBA teams. It starts by showing 2 NBA teams and the user has to click on which team they believe is better. Afterwards, the next 2 teams are displayed.

The teams and their rankings are stored in client-side arrays. The algorithm decides which 2 teams will be displayed depending on which information it still needs to determine the final ranking.

Once the algorithm has all the information it needs to determine the final ranking, the final ranking is displayed from the best to worst team. The user has the option to copy this ranking.
